##  About the Project

This is my **first fully functional personal portfolio website**, built to showcase my **skills, projects, and professional journey**. It combines elegant design with modern frontend technologies, highlighting both my development and teaching background.

###  Built With:
-  **React** – for a component-based UI
-  **Vite** – for blazing-fast builds and development
-  **Tailwind CSS** – for utility-first, responsive styling
-  **HTML5** – clean, semantic structure
